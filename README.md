## Introduction

Digital logic is the foundation of modern electronics. This repository aims to provide a collection of tools and examples to help you understand and implement digital logic concepts.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects included in this repository:

- **Logic Gates Simulator**: A simple simulator for basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.).
- **Flip-Flop Implementations**: Implementations of various types of flip-flops.
- **Karnaugh Map Solver**: A tool for simplifying Boolean expressions using Karnaugh maps.
- **VHDL/Verilog Examples**: Code snippets and projects written in VHDL and Verilog.

Feel free to explore the different directories for each project!

## Installation
